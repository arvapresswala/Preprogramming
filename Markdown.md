# What I did over this summer.

* #### July 

> I took summer school for *English* at **Stephen Lewis**. I researched university programs I could apply to. I decided that I will not be pursuing accounting as a career.  I had a very boring and uneventful summer over the first month.

* ### August

  > The second half my summer was a lot more exciting. I did the following things :

  1. Vegetable picking
  2. Berry picking
  3. Canada's Wonderland
  4. Celebrated my birthday.
  5. Baked desserts.
  6. [Blue Mountain](http://bluemountainvillage.ca/)               
     * Zip Lining
     * Roller coaster                                                                 ![roller](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4iV-Xn5u32M/maxresdefault.jpg)
