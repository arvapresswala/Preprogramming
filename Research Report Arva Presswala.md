1. ### Environmental

   * Outline a strategy to reduce the impact of computers and related technology on the environment and on human health

   Technology has evolved immensely in the past 15 years which has made our lives a lot easier. But the development of technology has been damaging our environment as well as our health. Some ways to reduce the harmful impact of technology on the environment is to make sure to recycle e-waste.  Recycling e-waste reduces negative effects on the environment so that the harmful toxins in the computers are disposed safely without harming the environment. Also, another way is to reduce power consumption. Disconnecting power cables after using the device and switching of the computer after using it are some ways to decrease power consumption and protect our environment. Moreover some methods to reduce the negative impact of technology on human health are getting regular exercise, taking a break from the computer or any device every one hour, make sure they socialize outdoors and buying ergonomic equipments.

2. ### Ethics

   - Analyze an ethical issue related to the use of computers

   As technology is constantly changing it is very difficult to set code of ethics in the field of computer science. The general ethics that should be followed are:

   **Avoid harm to others**

   Harm in this case doesn't necessarily refer to physical hurt, it refers to loss and modification of files, etc.  To minimize the possibility of indirectly harming others, computing professionals must minimize malfunctions by following generally accepted standards for system design and testing.

   **Honor property rights including copyrights and patent.** 

   Violation of copyrights, patents, trade secrets and the terms of license agreements is prohibited by law in most circumstances. Even when software is not so protected, such violations are not  professional behavior. Copies of software should be made only with proper authorization. Unauthorized duplication of materials must not be condoned.

   **Give proper credit for intellectual property.**

   People working in a computer science field are suppose to honor someone else's intellectual property. Specifically, one must not take credit for other's ideas or work, even in cases where the work has not been explicitly protected by copyright, patent, etc.

   **Respect the privacy of others.**

   Currently technology allows the collection and exchange of personal information more than it has ever been possible in the past. Thus, the violation of privacy ethics has increased. Professionals have responsibility to maintain the privacy of individuals and groups.  This implies that only the necessary amount of personal information be collected in a system, that the information should have a set retention and discarding time period , and that personal information gathered for a specific purpose not be used for other purposes without consent of the individual.

3. ### Emerging Technology

   Investigate and explain an emerging technology

   #### _Arcology_

   Arcology a blend of "architecture" and "ecology". This a feild in which architectural design principles are created for habitats that are highly populated so that we minimize the waste of land,  energy resource, time and are eco friendly.  It includes residential, commercial and agricultural facilities, allowing its residents a comfortable life without connections to traditional urban infrastructure like sewage or food production. An architect named Paolo Soleri is who first came up with the concept of arcology. Despite decades of work on the concept, arcologies seem to be remarkably difficult to build in the real world. The following are some of the real world arcologies that are currently under construction:

   **Arcosanti**

   Arcosanti is a planned community for 5,000 people in the Arizona desert, 70 miles north of state capital Phoenix. Since 1970, Soleri has worked with more than 6000 people for this project.  

   **Masdar City**

   In the United Arab Emirates is a planned city, designed by Foster and Partners. It's called Masdar City, and will rely solely on solar and other renewable energy sources, with a principle of zero-carbon, zero-waste. Six square kilometres have been set aside for the development, which will provide homes to 45,000 to 50,000 people and 1,500 businesses, including the International Renewable Energy Agency and the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology. Cars will be banned, with transport instead provided by mass transit and personal rapid transit systems.

   There are a few more constructions around the world which are still in the starting stages of constructions. 

4. ### Collaborative Research

   #### *Computer science with sociology*

   Computational sociology is a branch of sociology that uses computationally intensive methods to study  and duplicate social situations. It uses computer simulations, artificial intelligence, complex statistical methods, and analytic approaches like social network analysis to develop and test theories of complex social processes through bottom-up replicating of social interactions. Human Computer Interaction, Machine Learning, UI design are just a few of the areas that attempt to mimic or use information about the way humans think, understand and interact.

5. ### Theoretical Computer Science

   #### *Graph Theory*

   ![graph](http://www.dharwadker.org/pirzada/applications/figure_5.gif)

   In computer science, graphs are used to represent networks of communication, data organization, computational devices, the flow of computation, etc. For example, the link structure of a website can be represented by a directed graph, in which the vertices represent web pages and directed edges represent links from one page to another. Social media,travel, biology, computer chip design, and many other fields may use the same method to solve problems. Computer science has taken major intrest in developing algorithims to handle graphs.
