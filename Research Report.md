   Technology has evolved immensely in the past 15 years which has made our lives a lot easier. But the development of technology has been damaging our environment as well as our health. Some ways to reduce the harmful impact of technology on the environment is to make sure to recycle e-waste.  Recycling e-waste reduces negative effects on the environment so that the harmful toxins in the computers are disposed safely without harming the environment. Also, another way is to reduce power consumption. Disconnecting power cables after using the device and switching of the computer after using it are some ways to decrease power consumption and protect our environment. Moreover some methods to reduce the negative impact of technology on human health are getting regular exercise, taking a break from the computer or any device every one hour, make sure they socialize outdoors and buying ergonomic equipments.

2. ### Ethics

   - Analyze an ethical issue related to the use of computers

   As technology is constantly changing it is very difficult to set code of ethics in the field of computer science. The general ethics that should be followed are:

   **Avoid harm to others**

   Harm in this case doesn't necessarily refer to physical hurt, it refers to loss and modification of files, etc.  To minimize the possibility of indirectly harming others, computing professionals must minimize malfunctions by following generally accepted standards for system design and testing.

   **Honor property rights including copyrights and patent.** 

   Violation of copyrights, patents, trade secrets and the terms of license agreements is prohibited by law in most circumstances. Even when software is not so protected, such violations are not  professional behavior. Copies of software should be made only with proper authorization. Unauthorized duplication of materials must not be condoned.

   **Give proper credit for intellectual property.**

   People working in a computer science field are suppose to honor someone else's intellectual property. Specifically, one must not take credit for other's ideas or work, even in cases where the work has not been explicitly protected by copyright, patent, etc.

   **Respect the privacy of others.**

   Currently technology allows the collection and exchange of personal information more than it has ever been possible in the past. Thus, the violation of privacy ethics has increased. Professionals have responsibility to maintain the privacy of individuals and groups.  This implies that only the necessary amount of personal information be collected in a system, that the information should have a set retention and discarding time period , and that personal information gathered for a specific purpose not be used for other purposes without consent of the individual.
